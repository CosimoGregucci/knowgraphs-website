## The case of *Google Spain and Google*


The presentation is about the case of *Google Spain and Google*, decided by the European Court of Justice (Judgment of 13 May 2014, *Google Spain and Google*, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317). The case was decided within  the context of the preliminary ruling procedure.
The presentation focuses on two issues addressed by the Court in this case. More specifically the issues presented are:
(1) Whether Google should be considered a data controller, according to EU data protection, in relation to Google search operations.
(2) ‘The right to be forgotten’ in the sense of the a right of the data subject to have his name delinked from the Google search results.
In relation to the first issue, the presentation elaborates on the material scope of application of EU data protection law and presents the role of the data controller.
In relation to the second issue, it is presented how the European Court of Justice dealt with a question of balancing of competing rights and interests.
