# [Symbolic Vs Sub-symbolic AI Methods: Friends or Enemies?](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2699/paper06.pdf)

There is a long and unresolved debate between the **symbolic** and **sub-symbolic** methods.  However, in recent years, there is a push towards **in-between** methods. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of the symbolic, sub-symbolic and in-between approaches focused in the domain of **knowledge graphs**, namely, *schema representation*, *schema matching*, *knowledge graph completion*, *link prediction*, *entity resolution*, *entity classification* and *triple classification*. We critically present key characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of the main algorithms in each domain, and review the use of these methods in knowledge graph related applications.
