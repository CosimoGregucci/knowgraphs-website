## Presentation of the paper "Graph? Yes! Which one? Help!"
### Nikolaos Karalis - ESR2, Paderborn University

The most prominent graph data models for the representation of knowledge graphs are the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Labeled Property Graph model. This paper discusses several challenges that arise when it comes to the interoperability of RDF  and labeled property graphs. The discussion is based on the One Graph data model, which is introduced in this work and is able to represent both RDF and labeled property graphs.
