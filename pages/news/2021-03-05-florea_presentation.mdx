---date: 2020-03-05title: Research Colloquium Presentation by Marcu Florea---## Breyer Ruling, and Dynamic IP Addresses as Personal Data  ##This presentation focuses on case C-582/14 Patrick Breyer v Bundesrepublik Deutschland. 
The main focus of this week's session is on the concept of personal data, as it was defined by the European Court of Justice. The court discusses two options for deciding on whether an on-line identifier is personal data: one that involves a relative criterion (certain information is personal data in relation to an entity because it allows the user to be precisely identified, but not in relation to another entity that does not have the necessary information to identify the person without disproportionate efort) and one that involves an objective criterion (the same information is personal data even if only a third party can determine the identity of the data subject). The decision is very useful as a starting point for discussing the concept of personal data, pseudonymous personal data and anonymous personal data in knowledge graphs.The slides of the presentation can be found [here](/downloads/florea_colloquium_slides.pdf)
