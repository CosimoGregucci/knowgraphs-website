# EduCOR: An Educational and Career-Oriented Recommendation Ontology


**EduCOR** is an educational ontology for personalized recommendation learning systems that is based on a learning path and user profile. It represents the key components for a personalized learning system based on our requirement analysis.

With the increased dependence on online learning platforms and educational resource repositories, a unified representation of digital learning resources becomes essential to support a dynamic and multi-source learning experience. We introduce the EduCOR ontology, an educational, career-oriented ontology that provides a foundation for representing online learning resources for personalised learning systems. The ontology is designed to enable learning material repositories to offer learning path recommendations, which correspond to the userâ€™s learning goals, academic and psychological parameters, and the labour-market skills that are achieved from the learning path. 
We present the multiple patterns that compose the EduCOR ontology, highlighting its cross-domain applicability and integrability with other ontologies. A demonstration of the proposed ontology on the real-life learning platform [eDoer](https://labs.tib.eu/edoer/) is discussed as a use-case. We evaluate the EduCOR ontology using both gold standard and task-based approaches. The comparison of EduCOR to three gold schemata, and its application in two use-cases, shows its coverage and adaptability to multiple OER repositories, which allows generating user-centric and labour-market oriented recommendations.
