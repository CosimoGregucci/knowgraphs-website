---date: 2021-02-05title: Research Colloquium Presentation by Ines Akaichi---### Representing and Reasoning over Legal PoliciesIn the biweekly colloquium, I gave a presentation on policies and some of the commonly used approaches for policy specification. I  also presented two papers that propose techniques and approaches of how to encode and automatically analyse Legal text. At the end of the discussion, we had a very interesting discussion about some of the challenges of representing legal text in a machine-readable format, such as the ambiguity of legal text in some of the cases.The slides of the presentation can be found [here](/downloads/akaichi_colloquium_slides.pptx)
