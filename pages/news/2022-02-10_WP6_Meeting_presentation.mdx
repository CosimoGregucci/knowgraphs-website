## *Social Media Strategy*


On 10 February 2022, the Work Package 6 meeting, organised by University of Groningen, took place online. The dissemination team shared information about the communication progress so far and several ideas about future developments.
The ESRs discussed ideas about the content that can be shared in the social media and suggestions for further developing the outreach of the research. The next meeting about the dissemination strategy will take place in approximately 3 months.
