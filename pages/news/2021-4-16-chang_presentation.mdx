# Knowledge Graphs for Innovation
## Dawa Chang - ESR 13
### WU (Vienna University of Economics and Business)

The presentation was about **Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for innovation** along with the concept of *distant-search* and the related paper titled [DIS-C: conceptual distance in ontologies, a graph-based approach.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-018-1200-3)
It aimed to discuss how the KGs can help people overcome their cognitive limitations in creativity in the innovation processes and under what conditions. The innovation process, in this case, indicates *the fuzzy front-end stage* of new product/service development.
Searching for something referable/inspirational is the starting task often taken in the innovation process to ideate something new. What is recommended for this task is doing a *distant-search*, searching an ideation stimulus distantly from the domain that the individual has expertise or knowledge, as it is more likely to derive substantial innovation with greater novelty than doing a *local-search*. 
However, it requires defining the *distance* first to discuss further. The presentation has introduced conceptual distance and how to measure it by referring to the study of the DIS-C algorithm, which is for computing the conceptual distance between concepts of an ontology.
