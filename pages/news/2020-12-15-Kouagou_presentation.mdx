# Knowledge Graph Embedding
## N'Dah Jean Kouagou - ESR 11, Paderborn University


I presented the survey by Wang et al. on knowledge graph embedding techniques. Two categories of KG embedding techniques are discussed: 1) translational distance models, and 2) semantic matching models. The first class of approaches exploit distance-based scoring functions to measure the plausibility of facts. TransE is the simplest model in this category, and its direct extensions include TransH and TransG. The second class of approaches use semantic matching scoring functions. They measure the plausibily of facts by matching the latent semantics of entities and relations embodied in their vector representions.
RESCAL, Distmult, and (the most expressive) Neural Tensor Network (NTN) are models of this family.
