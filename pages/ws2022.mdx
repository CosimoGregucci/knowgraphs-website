## Programme

### Serving and Querying Open Knowledge Graphs on the Web
_Presenter_: <a href="https://knowgraphs.eu/AxelPolleres">Prof. Dr. Axel Polleres</a>

_Abstract_: This talk will be divided in two parts… Motivated by querying Wikidata as a rich source knowledge graph for all kinds of practical projects and applications, we will cover in a tutorial style manner SPARQL as a query language for KGs. We will also discuss RDF’s and SPARQL’s limits and related challenges: in terms of expressivity (for instance regarding querying contextualized graphs, such as property graphs)  but also in terms of the bottleneck of current SPARQL endpoints in terms of scalability and serving complex queries to many users/clients concurrently.<br/>
In the second half of the talk we’ll talk about a possible solution to this bottleneck from our own research: We will present and step by step introduce the WISE-KG [1,2] project, a framework for serving and querying SPARQL under high concurrency, to many users as an extension of the Linked Data Fragments Framework [3] by Verborgh et al. Time allowed, we will also cover and explain the underlying HDT [4]  queryable graph compression format, and give a further outlook on how polyglott persistence and replication models could make SPARQL querying of Distributed Knowledge Graphs more scalable. <br/>

### Embedding Knowledge Graphs and Graph Queries
_Presenter_: Dr. Michel Cochez

_Abstract_: Machine learning approaches have been applied successfully in many
fields, also in knowledge representation. For example, graph embedding
techniques have been taken up by the community as a tool to solve
various tasks. Also other models which connect the knowledge
representation (where information is typically represented in the form
of a graph) with the machine learning world exist.
In this talk, I will first give a general overview of the topics in
the field of representation learning for knowledge graphs, present
several of the algorithms used to obtain ambeddings, and then present
recent work on inductive representation learning and approximate graph
query answering.

### Challenges for Efficiently Creating and Maintaining Knowledge Graphs
_Presenter_: Prof. Dr. Maria-Esther Vidal

_Abstract_: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have gained momentum as expressive data structures to represent the convergence of data and knowledge spread across various data sources. Albeit coined by the research community for several decades, KGs play an increasingly relevant role in scientific and industrial areas. In particular, the rich amount of data existing in encyclopedic KGs like DBpedia and Wikidata, or domain-specific KGs (e.g., Bio2RDF) demonstrate the feasibility of integrating factual domain-specific knowledge following the Linked Data principles.<br/>
Data integrated into existing KGs are collected in heterogeneous formats or physically distributed over multiple data sources. The declarative definition of KGs using W3C recommended languages like R2RML and RML have gained momentum to provide transparent, maintainable, and traceable processes of KG creation. Nevertheless, KG creation is laborious, and various parameters like number and type of mapping assertions and data source complexities like large volume, variety, and high duplicate rates may considerably affect the performance of KG creation. Thus, the process of KG creation demands specialized data management techniques to scale the process of KG creation up.<br/>
In this tutorial, we present the challenges faced at data integration and knowledge engineering levels to empower the pipelines of KG creation. We will explain the role of knowledge extraction, mapping languages, integrity constraints, and provenance. We will further discuss techniques for planning and transforming heterogeneous data into RDF KGs following declarative mapping assertions specified in R2RML and RML. Given a set of mapping assertions, the planner provides an optimized execution plan by partitioning and scheduling the execution of the mapping assertions. Moreover, at the execution level,  we will discuss the role of physical operators in efficiently performing the optimized execution plans. The impact of these techniques will be addressed on state-of-the-art engines for RDF KG creation and existing benchmarks. Lastly, we will present strategies for efficiently validating integrity constraints over KGs specified using the W3C recommended language SHACL.<br/>
As a result, at the end of the tutorial, the attendees will put in perspective the benefits of planning the execution of pipelines for KG creation and validation, and the role of data management for efficiently constructing and assessing the quality of KGs.

### Querying Federations of Knowledge Graphs, Maribel Acosta
_Presenter_: Maribel Acosta

_Abstract_: Federations of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are composed of multiple, decentralized, autonomous sources that expose KGs on the web. To query such KGs, Federated Query Engines (FEQs) implement query processing techniques for reducing the execution time of queries while maximizing the answer completeness.<br/>
The first part of this talk will introduce the general architecture of FQEs with an overview of (i) source selection and query decomposition, (ii) query planning, and (iii) query execution techniques. We will learn that due to the decentralized and autonomous aspects of federated KGs, query planning and execution techniques can fail if the runtime conditions are not taken into account. To address this, we will present Adaptive Query Processing (AQP) tailored to federated KGs. We will focus on two types of adaptivity that produce results incrementally and address query performance issues due to network delays or suboptimal plans. In addition, this talk will present a metric for benchmarking querying approaches that produce answers incrementally.<br/>
In the second part of this talk, we will concentrate on heterogeneous KG federations. Heterogeneity in query processing can come in different forms, e.g., data models, languages, hardware, interfaces, etc. In this talk, we will focus on heterogeneous federations composed of interfaces with different expressivity. The Linked Data Fragments (LDFs) Framework defines the expressivity of the interfaces in terms of the class of SPARQL expressions they can evaluate and the metadata they provide. This talk will then present the challenges that FQEs face when querying KG federations with heterogeneous LDF interfaces. To address these challenges, in our most recent work, we propose an interface-aware framework that exploits the capabilities of the member of the federations to speed the query execution. This talk will conclude with an outlook on other research problems in the context of federations of KGs.

### Application Talk 3: Managing and Analyzing Legal Knowledge Graphs

_Presenters_: María Navas-Loro and Erwin Filtz

_Abstract_: There is a strong demand for access to legal information. For instance, the European Union portal EUR-Lex, which publishes legislation, case law, and other documents related to EU law, serves more than two million documents monthly. Nevertheless, the information required by different stakeholders (such as organizations, companies or citizens) is usually distributed through various sources and presented in different formats and languages, turning legal information retrieval into a time-consuming and tedious process. Legal Knowledge Graphs offer a solution to this situation. In this session, we will present several use cases of legal Knowledge Graphs, highlight the main challenges found and analyse the main lacks in the domain and the lessons learnt. We will go through the different phases of the construction of these Knowledge Graphs, from the search for sources of documents and their main impediments to the extraction of information from them to their subsequent transformation into graph elements.
