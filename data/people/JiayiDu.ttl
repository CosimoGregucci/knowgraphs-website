### ESR Profile Description

I am ESR-10 within working package 3, and am currently a PhD candidate at the Analytic Computing research group of the University of Stuttgart, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Steffen Staab.

### Work description

My research focuses on the problem of operation of Knowledge Graphs(Managing Polymorphic Knowledge Graphs). To be more precise, the main goal is to develop methods for efficient querying of polymorphic knowledge graphs that access a variety of data and knowledge sources (graph, relational, stream,...) in the back end. Currently I have been looking into how to bridge between a triple store and a knowledge graph embedding under the assumption that the embedding encodes the triples in the triple store to achieve efficient information retrieval.
