<p>I am currently an ESR at Babelscape in collaboration with Sapienza University (Rome, Italy).</p>

<h3>Work Description</h3>
<p>My research project is focuses on Multilingual Semantic Parsing using Lexicalized Knowledge Graphs. I propose a language-independent graph representation of natural language which will allow us to represent sentences expressing the same meaning across different languages with the same graph representation. After that, I am going to create a Truly Semantic Parser which can generate graph representations from sentences.</p>""" .
